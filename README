== Ruby on Rails Blog Starter Kit

This will be a fairly basic blog, with reliance on third-party plugins wherever possible.  It will have basic posting features, commenting, feeds (RSS/Atom/etc?), Akismet integration for commenting, adding to del.icio.us & digg, Gravatar integration, tagging, dynamic modules, and an admin login through OpenId for creating new posts/managing comments (edit/delete).  As stated above, the focus of this blog is not creating the next great blogging platform; I’m building a very simple blog app that meets my needs.  I’m opening it up to the community as a starter kit for anyone learning Rails (seasoned professionals, complete newbies, or anyone in between) to fork/customize for his/her own needs.  I will not be taking feature requests.  Instead, I would encourage anyone who feels this is lacking to fork it and add the features for themselves.
